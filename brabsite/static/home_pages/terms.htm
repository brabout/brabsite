      other information.<br>

      photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.<br>
      26. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you 
      on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights 
      set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content 
      on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on 
      the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, 
      publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property 
      rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies 
      owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you 
      have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your 
      jurisdiction.<br>
      27. The Service contains content owned by BRABOUT. BRABOUT Content is protected 
      by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between 
      you and BRABOUT, BRABOUT owns and retains all rights in the BRABOUT Content 
      and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, 
      service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying 
      the BRABOUT Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative 
      works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, 
      sell, license or otherwise exploit the BRABOUT Content.<br>

      copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part. All page headers, custom 
      graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or 
      trade dress of BRABOUT, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole 
      or in part, without prior written permission from BRABOUT.<br>
      29. It is BRABOUT 's intention for the Service to be available as much as 
      possible. However, there will be times when the Service may be interrupted, 
      including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for 
      emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or 
      equipment. Also, BRABOUT reserves the right to remove any Content from the 
      Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service 
      may continue to be stored by BRABOUT, including, without limitation, in 
      order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable 
      without a valid court order. Consequently, BRABOUT encourages you to maintain 
      your own backup of your Content. In other words, BRABOUT is not a backup 
      service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes 
      of Content backup or storage. BRABOUT will not be liable to you for any 
      modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss 
      of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to 
      breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information 
      may not be secure.<br>
      30. You agree that BRABOUT is not responsible for, and does not endorse, 
      Content posted within the Service. BRABOUT does not have any obligation 
      to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates 
      these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.<br>
      31. Any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will 
      not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and 
      agree that your relationship with BRABOUT is not a confidential, fiduciary, 
      or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit 
      any Content does not place BRABOUT in a position that is any different from 
      the position held by members of the general public, including with regard 
      to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation 
      of confidence on the part of BRABOUT, and BRABOUT will not be liable for 
      any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</p>
